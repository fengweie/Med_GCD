# MONICA
MONICA: Benchmarking on Long-tailed Medical Image Classification

## Introduction
We build a unified codebase called Medical OpeN-source Long-taIled ClassifiCAtion (MONICA), which implements over 30 methods developed in long-tailed Learning and evaluated on
12 long-tailed medical datasets covering 6 medical domains.

### Image Preprocessing for Non-Image Datasets
If you download from the correct links, most of the evaluated datasets are conducted in image format.
We need to process the MedMNIST data for the unified training. Please find ./utils/process_medmnist.ipynb for reference.
```python
for idx in range(train_images.shape[0]):
  img = train_images[idx]
  label = train_labels[idx][0]
  img_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
  save_name = 'train_%s_%s.jpg' %(idx, label)
  cv2.imwrite('%s/%s' %(target_dir+dataset, save_name), img_rgb)
```
To match the pre-split set in `./numpy/medmnist`, all the images in MedMNIST will be stored in the format **<em>{split}\_{image_idx}\_{label}.jpg</em>**.


## 2. The Structure of Pre-Split Numpy Files

For the unified benchmark, we have pre-split the `train/val/test` sets, which are stored in `numpy files`.

There are four numpy files for each dataset/setting.

Take the ISIC datasets as an example, we have the three split files which start with the split `'train/val/test'` followed by the imbalance ratio `100/200/500`, e.g, `train_100.npy`.

We also have one dictionary file, e.g, `dic.npy`.

In `./dataset/dataloader.py`, you can find how we access the image_name and its label:

```python
self.np_dict = np.load(dict_path,allow_pickle=True).item()
self.np_path = np.load(np_path,allow_pickle=True)
self.img_name = []
self.img_label = []
for _ in self.np_path:
  self.img_name.append(_)
  self.img_label.append(self.np_dict[_])
```

### Customized Datasets
You can conduct your datasets in the following format:
```python
import numpy as np
import random
data_name = ['image_%s'%i for i in range(1000) ]
label = np.random.randint(0,10,1000)
dic = {data_name[i]:label[i] for i in range(1000)}
random.shuffle(data_name)
train = data_name[:700]
val = data_name[700:800]
test = data_name[800:1000]
np.save('train',train)
np.save('val',val)
np.save('test',test)
np.save('dic',dic)
```
And replace the `img_path` and `np_path` with your numpy files in the config files.

## 3. Start Training

### Config Files

Take the isic_GCL_2nd as the example (only keep some important hyperparameters).
```yaml
general: # Define some general parameters.
  img_size: 224
  seed: 1
  num_classes: 8
  dataset_name: 'isic'
  method: 'GCL_2nd'

model:
  if_resume: True # If this is set as True, the model will load for the resume_path.
  resume_path: './outputs/isic/100_GCL_224_resnet50_True_256_1_50/best.pt' # If if_resume is set as False, this will not work.
  if_freeze_encoder: True # If if_resume is set as False, this will not work.
  model_name: resnet50
  pretrained: True # If load the default pretrained weights provided by timm (from huggingface).


datasets:
  sampler: GCL # Sampler strategy.
  img_path: '/mnt/sda/datasets/isic2019/train/' # The image will be loaded as `img_path + name stored in np_path'. So if you can leave this blank if the full path is stored in 'np_path'.
  train:
    np_path: './numpy/isic/train_100.npy'
    dict_path: './numpy/isic/dic.npy' # Make sure this is consistency to the keys stored in the dic files.
  val:
    np_path: './numpy/isic/val_100.npy'
    dict_path: './numpy/isic/dic.npy'
  test:
    np_path: './numpy/isic/test_100.npy'
    dict_path: './numpy/isic/dic.npy'
  transforms:
    train: 'strong'
    val_test: 'crop'

```

### Script Training
For non-MedMNIST Training, please use command like:
```bash
python main.py --config ./configs/isic/100/isic_ERM.yml
```

For MedMNIST Training, please find the `./train.sh` script for reference.
